# jayshozie's Dotfiles

Parts of my Neovim setup are yanked from
[The Primeagen](https://github.com/theprimeagen) and
[TJ DeVries](https://github.com/tjdevries). Thanks, guys, I wouldn't be using
Neovim if it wasn't for you. You made it possible to just jump into Neovim
and start using it.

[!] Most remaps are for dvorak, I use dvorak btw.

## TODO

- [ ] There is an issue with LSPs, lua_ls steals focus. I need to figure out
    how to fix this.

- [ ] Add Harpoon 
    - I'm waiting for Harpoon 2. I'll add that when it comes out. (If it ever does come out...)

- [x] Fix the issues with Fugitive
    - I constantly forgot my keymaps, so I unmapped them.
    I'm gonna use Flominal for git stuff, I may completely remove Fugitive in
    the future. I don't want to think about by dotfiles for some time.

- [x] Add LSPs
    - [x] C/C++
    - [x] Lua
    - [x] Python
    - Holy sh\*t this took a really long time.
